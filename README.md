# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is **diabetic or not** based on health-related data such as glucose level, BMI, insulin levels, age, and more.  
It uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** and applies a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** model with feature scaling for better accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: PIMA Indians Diabetes Database  
- **Features**:
  - Pregnancies  
  - Glucose  
  - BloodPressure  
  - SkinThickness  
  - Insulin  
  - BMI  
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
  - Age  
- **Target**:
  - `0` → Not Diabetic  
  - `1` → Diabetic

📈 Results

Accuracy achieved: ~76% on test data

Model: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Standardization was applied for better performance

🔮 Future Improvements

Try more models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks

Use cross-validation for more reliable results

Build a Streamlit / Flask web app for interactive predictions
