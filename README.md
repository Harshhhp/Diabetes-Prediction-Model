# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a person is diabetic based on health-related features such as glucose level, BMI, age, insulin levels, etc. . The model was built using Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with feature scaling (StandardScaler) to improve performance.
